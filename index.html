  <p>Hi. I'm Gary J. Kealy.</p>
  <p>After a miserable attempt at becoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgJPjG4KJYQ">Richard Feynman</a>, I studied journalism and got a BA in media production management. Meanwhile, I did some work in page layout and design. After university I learnt how to make websites and started a company, mainly putting together Wordpress themes with <a href="https://roots.io">Sage</a>. Earlier this year my wife and I moved from Dublin, Ireland to San Antonio, Texas. When we're not complaining about the roads, we're marvelling about almost everything else.</p>
  <p>I'm available for any web or graphic design you might need doing, so have a look a my little <a href="http://gkealy.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> and get in touch.</p>
