Thankfully, I have moved to a position of known ignorance where the United Sates is concerned. Despite years of consuming American media, I often feel like a duck out of water here in San Antonio.

Many a time have I looked down on the American tourist in Dublin. They seem stupid and uncultured. Why, if they speak the same language, do they seem so clueless?

As it turns out, language is just one facet of culture, and it's culture that dictates the ease with which one can navigate .. well, the culture. Luckily, my American hosts are more tolerant of me than I was of their wandering compatriots.

Guillermo Fesser, at an event organised by Casa de Espana, spoke about how sources of fact about American life are disregarded by Europeans as fiction. This rings true. On arrival there was a sense of familiarity. People seemed like characters and places like settings. It was all very strange until I realised (doh!) that these were the people that the fiction was about.

As fiction has turned out to be a source of truth, so fact has turned out to be a source of falsehood. Maybe half truth rather than falsehood but nonetheless. Basically, there is far more to the US than it's international affairs or the domestic issues that make it into international media. Watching CNN in San Antonio feels like watching Euronews in Dublin.

It's embarrassing to admit that this is a surprise. I suspect are many more in store.
