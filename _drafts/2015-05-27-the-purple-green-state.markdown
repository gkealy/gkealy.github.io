Here are some things I learnt about Texas this week:

1 Fracking caused earthquakes last year in [Azle](http://www.smu.edu/News/2015/earthquakes-azle-report-21april2015)

There was suggestion that [policymakers were dismissive](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/texas-policymakers-unconvinced-as-scientists-link-/nk2st/?) on the topic but the Railroad Commission (Texas still has a railroad commission. See below) seems to have been pretty quick to ask two suspect drilling operations why they should not be [shut down](http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/barnett-shale/article19437057.html).

2 Texas still has a [Railroad Commission](http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/)

The Texas government has a plural executive branch. This means that the executive is made up of a number of elected officials. Complicating things further, the Energy Commission is called the Railroad Commission. It's written in to the constitution, meaning a large number of politicians need to agree on a name change before a referendum is put the people. Apparently there are concerns about [unintended consequences](http://www.texastribune.org/2015/04/20/texas-mulls-railroad-commission-name-change-again/).

3 Texas is not a subtle place

Somebody said that once. They could've been referring to any number of things but it's certainly true of the weather.

4 Texas is not as red as it looks from the outside

Anecdotally at least, this is true both politically and environmentally. While policy might look rather [red](http://www.texastribune.org/2015/04/22/first-bill-against-same-sex-marriage-passes-commit/comments/), the people I've met and the media I've read, watched, and listened to have produced a purple hue (haze?). The environment, far from being dusty and dry, is an unambiguous, luscious green.
